## *************** Mitosis Parameters  **************
regional_mitosis_flag 1

## Mitosis Border Percent
## **********************
## The position, in fraction of the GZ (from posteriormost EN stripe to posterior of GZ,

## Mitosis Transition Times
## ************************
## A list of times at which the mitosis rates for the regions will change
