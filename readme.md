##BEFORE USING THE MODEL

On a Mac, open 'Batch Manager Mac.command'. On a Windows or Linux computer, open a command prompt, cd to the 'BatchManager' directory and run './dist/main_UI'. This will open the Batch Manager, where --most importantly--you can change the params file. 

Now, you may run the simulation like normal 

##WHEN USING THE MODEL

There are two options for using the model. You can run 'tcseg.cc3d,' which runs the simulation once; alternately, you can use 'tcseg_batch_.cc3d' to run the simulation multiple times. However, in the latter case, make sure to use a proper params.xml!

Contact Jeremy about how to write a params.xml for running the simulation in batches.
